Marc-Andre, Etienne,

Following our first two sessions, where we discussed the premise behind the kWh estimator tool and the broader origination scaling objective ('closing more deals, faster'), I have been reviewing the estimator output/proposal (ref: Vieux Quebec proposal attached) and benchmarked it against other commercial solar proposals I have seen... 

Below is a "punch list" I have created to summarize findings and recommendations for enhancement.

Punch list: Vieux Québec proposal improvements

1. Make the proposal feel "more real” --> project-specific grounding
While the proposal output is sleek, it reads like a dashboard screenshot.
Whereas, to make this feel real, it should read like project plan. 
For e.g., we could add a “Project Snapshot” block (1 page, max), that shows:
key equipment, site load/usage and demand context, all of which we already obtain/capture through the lead capture/bill uploads,
This adds immediate value to the engagement, where clients might be initially curious / skeptical to answer the most fundamental question: 'what is the solar potential on my building?'
Show a clear Year-1 PV production estimate (ideally, also methodology and expected seasonable variance)
Provide a simple site aerial + layout image (basic super-imposed “solar layout” visual that frames many relevant commercial discussion points. 
2. Add an “Assumptions & Exclusions” table (this is a must!)
The proposal already shows “Important Notices” (validity 30 days, preliminary nature, site visit required etc.) — it now also needs a table highlighting the assumptions that ground our analysis/findings. This will instill a level of clarity in how we arrive at specific (and credible) outputs. 
By showing a table with key inputs (i.e. current hutility rate/HQ tariff, inflation, degradation, change in electricity needs, etc.) the proposal and calculations creates immediate credibility and traceable for parallel analysis by the client. This same section is also a good place to identify explicit exclusions! 
Tariff code + export/self-consumption program assumptions (HQ)
Utility price escalation assumption (if any)
PV degradation assumption
Battery degradation / augmentation assumption (or explicitly excluded)
O&M cost assumptions (included / excluded / optional)
Electrical upgrades inclusions/exclusion (i.e. service upgrades, switchgear, protection, metering etc.)
Roof work cost exclusions (*in fact, this might point to an entire separate section, like an Appendix, especially where roof repair work is needed prior to installation AND/OR requires consideration during solar system's service life)
Assumptions around interconnection costs and timelines, which should always be shown as 'preliminary', pending HQ requirements clarifications 
3. Show equipment details & warranties (even if preliminary)
Another key "trust builder" in commercial solar proposals is the listing of assumed component list:
Solar panel type and quantity (+ warranty duration)
Inverter manufacturer and (+ std. warranty duration)
Workmanship warranty 
Add (“indicative”):
PV module and inverter type class (and optional “final selection after detailed design”)
storage system class (manufacturer TBD is fine, but specify warranty targets)
workmanship / performance warranty intent (even if “standard EPC warranty”)
4. Financial section improvements: clarify “net investment” and what it includes
The proposal currently highlights 
25-year savings ~$1.7M,
net investment $601k (after incentives),
payback 8.7 years,
IRR 9.7%.
That’s good, but prospects will immediately wonder/ask “What’s inside those numbers?”
Add:
Clear, pre-incentive EPC price ($ amount that will also be in the EPC contract)
Incentives broken out (ITC, HQ incentives, depreciation, etc.)
Net cost calculation (so the “$601k” is very traceable)
A quick “Does/does not include” box (another place to clarify key exclusions, like electrical upgrades, roof work, crane rental, etc.)
This could read: “Preincentive Cost” → incentive stack → “NET SYSTEM COST” --> payback/IRR. 
5. Add a simple project timeline + responsibilities table
A basic timeline with “kWh tasks vs client's tasks,” as an effective way to reduce uncertainty (drives confidence = conversions). 
Add a QC/HQ-appropriate version:
Contract execution → Preliminary design & Site visit → Engineering → Permit & Interconnection application submission → Installation → commissioning
Highlight “potential revision points” (HQ response, engineering/structural findings, electrical constraints)
6. Make “Next Steps” more conversion-optimized (without overcommitting)
The proposal already has a “Design Agreement” next step, with Design Fee ($2,500 + taxes) credited if they proceed. Now, tighten it to clearly explain what happens next, AND make the first step low-friction.
Add:
What the design fee covers (site visit + prelim engineering + HQ interconnection package prep + firm quote)
What the customer must provide (12–24 months bills, roof info, lease info, electrical one-line if available)
What the customer gets (firm quote, schedule, clarified scope + exclusions)
7. Add “Qualification flags” to prevent proposal churn
Given commercial realities, kWh should proactively include a “Conditions to Confirm” checklist (also helps lead qualification workflow):
Real estate ownership/authority (i.e. whether it’s a triple-net lease etc.)
Roof condition and re-roof timeline
Tenant approvals / lien holder approvals
Structural review requirement
Electrical service constraints/upgrade requirements
This is how we preserve the “fast quote/turnaround” differentiator (without risking "death-by-revision"!) 
8. “About kWh” claims need to be more-defensible
The “About kWh Québec” section states 10+ years experience, 500+ completed projects, 50MW+ installed capacity. This risks scrutiny, unless we show partner credentials (i.e. MA's construction/EPC history, Etienne's LCAB solar asset management perspective, my 15yrs in solar EPC etc.)
In conclusion, IMO addressing the above 'punch list' would help us bring the kWh proposal (estimator output) up to a needed standard in order to accelerate lead-to-opportunity/contract conversions.  
I suspect that MA's Riplet-proficiency will help rework these changes quickly. We can then review the updated output. 
The output changes should also help consider how to tighten/prioritize the other lead journey and estimator process improvements. For e.g. adding process gates that lead to more meaning/relevant outputs that minimize human error when reviewing and assessing leads and opportunities (i.e. flag for "needs roof info", "likely lease complexity", clarifying near-term load change validations etc.).  
We can review and discuss these in greater detail during our next call tomorrow. 
We should also align on the next steps & area of focus - i.e. defining key qualifier questions (i.e. can be for the estimator and/or for a sales call script to validate site/opportunity viability) so that we are setting-up for the desired project pilots to further validate effective process steps. 
Thanks,   
Oleg.
