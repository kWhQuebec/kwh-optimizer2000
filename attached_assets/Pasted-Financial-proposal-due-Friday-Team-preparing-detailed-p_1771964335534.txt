Financial proposal due Friday: Team preparing detailed package covering costs, assumptions, and terms for the Dream project.

Global proposal format established: Covers 23 sites with site-specific pricing; considers volume discounts and client modeling needs.

Procurement risk identified: 40-80 megawatt threshold affects direct orders; reliance on existing vendors mitigates cost risks.

Data collection ongoing: 26 sites assessed; 3 sites don't meet criteria; inputs are being finalized for the proposal.

Automation tools in development: Automatic creation of solar layouts and SLDs aims to enhance design speed and accuracy.

Community engagement seen positively: Early discussions with local authorities diminish risks, despite low turnout at sessions.


Notes
Financial Proposal Preparation
The team is focused on creating a detailed financial package for the Dream project proposal, with a firm deadline by Friday.

Comprehensive financial model summary required for the proposal covering DC size, AC size, first-year degradation, availability, and useful life (01:45)

Highlighted data in yellow and blue from the model must be included; other data is internal only
Project costs must detail installed cost, municipal fees, and specify Dream’s covered costs
A major repair cost assumption needs to be developed for future use
Terms and conditions will include deposit requirements on equipment to maintain a net-zero cash flow
Proposal format and site pricing structure decided to accommodate client financial modeling needs (05:41)

Proposal will be a single global document covering all 23 sites with pricing broken down per site
Presentation flexibility discussed, such as grouping multiple sites per page to balance detail and readability
Pricing strategy must consider volume discounts and panel procurement thresholds
Panel procurement volume threshold risks outlined around the 40-80 megawatt range impacting direct ordering leverage (06:12)

Below threshold, sourcing would shift to third parties, potentially increasing costs
Existing vendor relationships with Chen provide some flexibility on minimum orders
Team must stay vigilant on volume to maintain cost effectiveness
Data and inputs gathering status reported with some site data ready and ongoing efforts to finalize all inputs before Friday (07:01)

Current spreadsheet includes 26 sites, with 3 sites failing technical criteria
James is chasing inputs and corrections, such as errors in Single Line Diagrams (SLD)
Marc-André will duplicate and adapt the model for all sites based on available data
Technical Visualization and Design Automation
Efforts are underway to automate solar panel layout visualization and improve technical planning efficiency.

Automatic SLD creation in progress to generate solar panel arrays and layouts across all sites (15:51)

Marc-André is building tools to visualize panel arrays and create Single Line Diagrams automatically
This automation aims to speed up site design and improve accuracy with less manual work
The tool remains a work in progress but is already functional for some sites
Equipment sizing and design parameters clarified supporting consistent system specifications (16:21)

Siemens inverter sizes of 125 kW, 155 kW, and 375 kW identified as standard options
Panel model identified as Jinko 660, with some gaps noted in the model data
James suggested incorporating sizing input to allow automated calculations in future iterations
Updated equipment pricing and packages available for integration into design and cost models (17:35)

Siemens equipment packages uploaded with current pricing
These enable accurate cost estimation aligned with technical design
Marc-André is positioned to update tools accordingly for proposal preparation
Stakeholder Engagement and Regulatory Considerations
Proactive communication with local authorities and regulatory bodies is helping to de-risk the project and avoid delays.

Community and municipal engagement viewed as a major positive despite low attendance at some sessions (09:01)

Early conversations with city and fire department reduce risk of unexpected objections
James emphasized this advance dialogue as a “huge win” for project smoothness
Smaller cities like Vaudreuil are involved, with Montreal having more prior solar experience
Airport proximity and regulatory impact assessed with favorable initial findings (10:12)

Panels near airports require Transport Canada approval only if cranes are used in installation
Existing installations near airports used as precedent for approval confidence
Safety measures and clean site management reported rigorously followed during prior builds
Site-specific logistical notes shared reflecting operational discipline and risk awareness (11:54)

Staging and fencing practices ensure compliance and safety near critical infrastructure
Team demonstrated strong site management, reducing potential operational disruptions
Project Management and Coordination
The team is balancing tight deadlines with data collection challenges while maintaining clear communication and support.

Deadline set for proposal package submission by Friday driving current workload intensity (07:01)

James is actively chasing inputs and correcting data errors to meet the timeline
Marc-André committed to building out deliverables with ongoing updates to James
Collaborative workflow established combining data sharing, tool development, and regular check-ins (14:27)

Use of SharePoint for file sharing with clear file naming conventions (e.g., Dream financial model)
Plans for joint review sessions next week to finalize details and address outstanding issues
James offered full availability to support progress and push deliverables forward
Workload and resource awareness acknowledged with focus on prioritizing critical tasks (14:41)

Both speakers expressed readiness to adapt schedules to meet project needs
Emphasis on avoiding delays despite competing priorities like community sessions
Communication tone reflects strong teamwork and mutual support to maintain momentum (18:12)

Positive rapport evident, helping sustain motivation under pressure
Clear ownership of tasks with openness to help and feedback

Action items
James Pagonis
Provide detailed assumptions and costs (installed cost, municipal fees, project cost components) from the financial model to Marc-André for inclusion in the proposal document (01:45)
Send final inputs and relevant scope of work documents (solar and O&M) from the client to Marc-André as soon as received (03:34)
Share the Excel model file location and ensure Marc-André has access to the highlighted version for work on the proposal (13:12)
Continue chasing pending inputs from stakeholders to finalize financial model details for all sites (08:43)
Provide input on deposit terms and contract language to include in the proposal (04:26)
Support Marc-André as needed in proposal preparation until Friday deadline (17:58)
Marc-André La Barre
Use the shared Excel model as a template to build out the financial and proposal document for all 23 sites, ensuring the inclusion of only relevant highlighted data (07:32)
Develop the covering page and detailed pricing presentation per site or consolidated proposal as discussed, adapting format to client needs (04:35)
Incorporate equipment data, inverter sizes, and Siemens pricing into proposals based on updated files provided (16:12)
Continue work on automation tools for solar panel visualization, array design, and automatic SLD generation (14:27)
Keep James updated on progress and raise any required clarifications before Friday (13:48)
